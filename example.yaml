# =========================
#  ALL FEATURES DEMO SHOP
# =========================
# This file shows every available field with explanations.
# Notes:
# - The plugin **shows all items** every cycle, but each item rolls against `chance`.
#   If it "wins", it's available with the stock you define (min/max or unlimited).
#   If it "loses", it stays visible but shows "Not available this cycle" and can't be bought.
# - `unlimited-stock: true` ignores min/max stock and only `max-per-player` limits a player.
# - For VANILLA items:
#     type: VANILLA
#     material: <Bukkit Material name>   (icon comes from that material)
#   Optional: display-name, lore (if omitted, Minecraft default name is used)
# - For CUSTOM items:
#     type: CUSTOM
#     icon: <Bukkit Material to display as the icon in the GUI>
#     give-command: "<command with %player% placeholder>" (required to deliver the item)
#     execute-as: CONSOLE | PLAYER  (default CONSOLE)
# - Color codes in text support &-codes (e.g., "&b", "&6").
# - `visible-slots` controls how many trades appear (we show all items, so set this â‰¥ item count to avoid paging).
